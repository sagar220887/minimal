### Telecom Fraud detection

Telecom fraud and further security infringements can be contained and minimised by enforcing a full end-to-end strategy. Telecom providers and carriers have alert systems in place to warn them of any violations. In addition to the measures that providers take, self-evaluating and staying informed of the device’s security and services can reinforce protection and avoid fraudulent action or threats.
**Fake and synthetic IDs:** Fraudsters manipulate ID documents by combining information with a decoy identity to create a synthetic ID to bypass detection systems. Detection of these IDs is more formidable since parts of synthetic IDs are legitimate.
**Virtual SIM cards:** Even though eSIMs – virtual SIM cards – are better protected from cloning or stealing, virtual SIMs are still prone to malware and social engineering attacks.
**Social engineering attacks:** With the pandemic greatly amplifying the volume and complexity of phishing attacks, more personalized instances such as CEO fraud and spear-phishing attempts are on the rise. Be it via SMS, calls, social engineering, or even using deep fake technology, social engineering attacks are on the rise to steal and misuse secure data.
